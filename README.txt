The Play :

	play is anti-clockwise.
	Total eight tricks have been play in each round.
	The play can be divided into two phases: 
	i)  First phase : Before the bidder's face down trump card is exposed.
	ii) Second phase : After the bidder's face down trump card is exposed.



1. First phase :

i. The player to the dealer's right leads to the first trick.
ii. Other players must follow suit if possible.
iii. The highest card of the suit led wins the trick, and the winner of each trick belongs to that team.
iv. If player have no card of the suit which playing on led have two options:
	a) You may discard any card. This card cannot win the trick.
	 OR
	b) Before playing a card, you may call for the bidder's face down trump to be exposed.
	In this case, the bidder must turn this trump card face up for all to see (if it is a 'seventh card'then added to the bidder's hand).
		Having called for the trump to be exposed, you must play a trump to this trick if you have one.
		If you have no trump you may discard any card.

2. Second phase :

i. Beginning with the trick in which the trump card is exposed, each trick is won by the highest trump in it. 
ii. Tricks that contain no trumps are won by the highest card of the suit led.
iii. Players must follow suit if possible: if unable to follow, they may play a trump or discard a card of another suit, as they like.



Scoring for a round :

1. When all eight tricks have been played, each side counts the card points in the tricks it has won.
2. The bidding team needs at least as many card points as the bid to win; otherwise they lose.



Keeping team score :

1. Each team keeps score using a red Six ('hearts' or 'diamond') and a black Six ('clubs' or 'spades'), from the cards not used in the game. 
	These are arranged to display either a number of red pips, representing a positive score, or a number of black pips, for a negative score. 
2. At the start of the game no pips are showing.
3. If the bidding side wins, they expose one extra red pip or (if they had black pips showing) cover one black pip; if they lose they expose a black pip or (if they had red pips showing) cover one red pip.
4. If all red Six pips open of a team they will win the game.
5. If all black Six pips open of a team they will lose the game.
6. The game goes on until all six pips of black or red are open.



Miscellaneous Rules : 
	The game is cancelled if any of the following things happen.
1. If any player possesses four jacks.
2. If all 8 cards are pointless of the player to the dealer's right leads.
3. If the opposite pair playing against the bidding pair do not have any of the 8 trump cards (but this can be known only at the end of a game).
4. If the player next to the shuffler has point-less cards in first deal.



Pair Rule :

	The pair rule increases or decreases the bid by 4 point. 

1. Got the king and queen of the trump suite (either the bidder or his partner alone (Not jointly), also valid for the opponent team.
2. They got at least 1 hand/pit/trick previously. (not in the current trick)
3. The trump is open.
4. It is not necessary to say 1st card or 2nd card. (just play one by one this pair)
5. Now by the power of the pair the bid value decreases by 4 (if bid is 20, bid change to 20-4=16).
6. If the opponent gets the pair. Then the bid value increases by 4 (if bid is 20, bid change to 20+4=24).
